<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>i remember that perhaps i was in 3rd year of my B.Tech when i enrolled myself in GLOBSYN for one month vocational
  training. perhaps it was on JAVA. I couldn't complete that project bcoz of my less programming knowledge or u can 
  say bcoz of my inferiority complex. i gave up and escaped from there.
</p>

<p>From that moment onwards when i escaped from there, i had a FIRE inside me that i have to bolster my programming 
  knowledge anyhow. I used to think about WEB DEVELOPMENT. But, u know sometimes in the race of life u won't choose
   that what u have to do in d life; instead,the life chooses that what u need to do. The time was passing by; i was facing 
   ups & downs of life but couldn't get the right time or situation to learn about the WEB DEVELOPMENT/DESIGNING.
</p>

<p>and now whan i am a bit established in my life; the old nourished dream has come to the surface and reminding me 
  to fulfill it. i have started the journey. Yes! , i am late but i have the happiness that i started it. if u had read 
  'THE ALCHEMIST' by Paulo Coelho u must have gone through a stanza when a man/boy starts his journey/job very very very
  late and shares with his friend that he had a dream to do this job but couldn't start doing this bcoz of so many
   problems in life. he also shares(in the novel) with his friend that though very late, but he has started it and he is 
  really happy. i have started the web development course and i hope that in few months i will be among one of the pioneers
in WEB DEVELOPMENT. </p>
